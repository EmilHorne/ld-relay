// Package relay contains the basic implementation of the Relay application. Currently, this is
// simply a thin wrapper around the core code. In the future, it may contain additional logic that
// is not included in the Enterprise application (for instance, an endpoint handler that is replaced
// by a different handler in Enterprise).
